# kagami

FFXIV ACT overlay for capturing used actions, including GCDs/oGCDs/auto-attacks/pet actions/items and more.

*kagami* means **mirror** in japanese. 

###### so where can i use this?

- 
- who wants to record his/her rotation in video
- who wants to show his/her rotation in stream
- ...maybe more!



## feature

- show GCDs / oGCDs
- show AAs / hide AAs
- show pet actions / hide pet actions
- scale viewport / icon sizes
- melee positional check *(exclude SAM, currently working on it)*
- interrupted castings check



## installation

1. get ACT and FFXIV 



## known issues

- cannot indicate pet before *kagami* launch
  (you have to re-summon your pet after launch *kagami*ðŸ˜¥)
- item, mount icons are coming out later than expected timing
- SAM positional support
- pet ghosted action tracking
